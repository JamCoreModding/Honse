# Honse

Are you tired of your ugly horses? Honse.

[The Honse](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/honse) is a mystical creature. A wide horse if you will.

This mod adds in the Honse, as seen in the screenshots below.

## Why?

The Honse must be kept alive, we must revive it. (But seriously, I don't know why I'm doing this, this is perhaps one of
my lowest moments as a modder.)
